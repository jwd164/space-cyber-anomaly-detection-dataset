# SCAD: Space Cyber Anomaly Detection Dataset

The **SCAD Dataset** (Space Cyber Anomaly Detection Dataset) provides high-fidelity 
satellite telemetry under both normal operating conditions and simulated cyber 
intrusion scenarios. It is designed as a public benchmark for developing and 
evaluating AI/ML-based intrusion detection systems for space missions.
